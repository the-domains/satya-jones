London commuters had already left,my train carriage was half empty,so I sat back to religiously unfold the daily Guardian. I was glad to be on my way,but then noted my level of unease.</p><p>As in the Green Dragon yesterday,I had a feeling that someone was there with me,a haunting ghost that I could not lay to rest. So I concentrated on its evocation into substantial <a href="http://being.It" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being.It</a> was of course Jay who appeared, not as he is now,but as he might have been before personality shattered on cusp of manhood. He had never recovered from his collapse - and neither had I.</p><p>He had been a vital,robust young man,eager for life, and with a Brazilian girlfriend - but his vulnerability,and his recklessness had led to his destruction.But now he was sitting in the seat opposite,solid,eagerly groomed,my handsome son - so I let myself wander into this compensatory fantasy.We were on a day out from Cambridge to relive past sharings : games of tennis in Highgate,and,further back,kite flying on the Heath.</p><p>Parliament hilltop - kite hill - on a Sunday afternoon,looking down over London from a vantage point above the <a href="http://city.It" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">city.It</a> was  always a chance to give Julia a break.A <a href="http://rebonding.Tennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebonding.Tennis</a> had relaxed grace and strength - but kite flying had transcendental flow. He was always eager to allow the kite,an orange diamond with long dragon tail,to become a distant speck that swooped  across the disc of a nurturing sun which too early in his life was to show its full malevolence - by deforming him into a shadow.</p><p>But by now I had become that kite,looking down at myself sitting in a carriage of a train snaking across the landscape :   ie : Jack Jones,narrating himself far beyond mid-life crisis, his life insubstantial as a speck in the sky,a wandering spark of fire in an infinite universe,both within and without - as he creates himself in a homage to existence.His spirit yearns for a higher, more inclusive reality of being - but this is not forthcoming.</p><p>Jack knows,just now in this moment of time’s conundrum,that this departure from Julia and Jay is a sort of closure - even if it proved only to be his heart temporarily floating free in space -or perhaps his heart has finally died.Over the years he had to care,and yet not care: a detached compassion that he nurtured in order to turn pain into <a href="http://insight.It" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insight.It</a> was impossible,but he tried, enabling the wind to sigh a tune on the broken strings of hope.</p><p>To witness witless suffering of those he loved,and be complicit in it,to feel a responsibility towards those he wished to escape from,to watch them slowly slide into a state of entropy was,on one level,the essence of conscious human life – and the effort was to transform this witnessing consciousness into beatitude, because the only possible closure,the final witness,would be in death,but whose death would it be,or the death of whose ego?</p><p>Jack knows,even as his train thunders on into the future,that he will continue spinning about life’s suffering vortex,whose one viable end would be through individual,personal death,and though he could perceive an essence of the past in the present, he had no final knowledge of the ultimate outcome of this little cosmic drama. A shattered family was the mirror image of the fragmented human tragedy that he may never comprehend, but learn to live within the mystery of life,and question God.</p><p>As he did so,Jack re-embodied his omniscience back into the train,and now sat looking out at the speeding countryside,and so….. I was back responding through my subjective senses,an essence of that consciousness remaining at my core,reminder of our deepest being: our state of witnessing,redemptive,bliss. </p><p>I can see the ticket collector coming down the carriage under his cap - and here am I,Jack Jones,sitting in my cap and bells.I open my wallet which contains my club card,library card,travel card,credit card,debit card…and train ticket, which he inspects, then clips.I count my ready cash - which,given the state of the world,is neither too little nor too much - even as idiot politicians who stoke turbo-capitalism tip us all towards planetary hell.We require an enlightened,compensatory approach to the monkey mind of natural human biological <a href="http://greed.One" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greed.One</a> neither totalitarian socialist,nor closed ranks of corporate industrial power.What the planet needs on a supra-national basis is a single language, designed urban growth, and a massive programme of state supported agricultural settlements.This will not happen without the long anticipated leap in human consciousness – for mutual threat of environmental collapse makes no impression on us - meanwhile, it’s business as usual,even to the end of the world.</p><p>Is it that this delusory human consciousness is eternally so - as generations pass through this illusionary world - so thus given the chance to learn compassion,leading to our enlightenment?</p><p>Upon arrival at Kings Cross station,I metamorphised from the chrysalis of my train carriage into humanity’s anarchic crowd, and was swept towards a Tube which I slid into -a tapeworm travelling through city bowels,to regurgitate at Victoria for the overground train to the subur, and from there took the tram to our local park,which I crossed over at sundown,and was home.</p><p>At last Grace and I would meet.We had parted some weeks before on an uncertain note,this city hovering on the brink of anarchy - and so I now surprised her by being there when she returned from work,greeting her with her teacup in my hand. She seemed tired at the end of her working week,but quietly overjoyed.We sat on the sofa in silence,until she commented:</p><p>‘I’m glad we survived those riots.We left at just the right time.’</p><p>I hooted like some wise old owl.’<a href="http://Yes.It" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes.It</a> could have escalated.’</p><p>That abiding image of a woman leaping from a high window,lit by the light of flames.We had been trapped indoors,looking at  anarchic TV events as they unfolded around us.Shop windows shattered and pillaged by a smiling mob.Blood and glass on the screen,while the sky all around us had been bright with fires reflected from the low clouds.I’d opened a window, and heard the city chaos howling.The next day dawned in a sky thick with smoke.We had packed rucksacks to walk the cracked paving stones,past,blistered shopfronts,and bewildered faces - then parted at the bus stop,not knowing when we would next meet .</p><p>‘Prince Charles flew in later,’she said.’A sky full of helicopters.’</p><p>‘Royalty visited East End in the Blitz….First time here,maybe?’</p><p>‘Well,there’s a statue of Victoria by the library,and the present Queen Elizabeth opened Jubilee Gardens in the 1950’s…….’</p><p>‘So we won’t setting up the Guillotine in the park,then,’I smiled.</p><p>She put her cup down with a laugh,and I grabbed to pull her down to the thick rug,and we lay face to face - that same face we wear all though our lives to beam out messages,enhancing what’s given by deeply etching its own history.Hers is impish, studied,kind - mine is worried,quixotic,even noble - but we shared a humour that undercut the tension inherent in both our stances, and we rolled about laughing and hugging each other. It was time to rattle the cage in sex - to almost become as one.</p><p>‘….Let’s go for a run first.Just the 3 parks run.Only 30 minutes.’</p><p>‘Huh?’her eyes widened…..’You cannot be serious,Jack Jones.’</p><p>‘I mean <a href="http://it.You" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it.You</a>’ve been cooped up all day.I’ve been travelling.’</p><p>We got out just as the low sun was sparking the tops of the trees into shimmering light.I was a natural springy runner,but lazy,whereas by working at it she had honed herself into some style and stamina.I usually ran on my own in a plain old tshirt, whereas she trained with the Running Sisters,in designer gear.</p><p>Running always braces you beyond immediate environment.On freezing days,you transcend.On sweltering,or rainy days,you withdraw, settling into meditation as you pound along.I got into the ‘zone’ as we left futuristic towers behind,crossing a wide park before loping through  traffic jams,then winding through the Canada Geese that trimmed grass verges by The Ponds,one of the sources of our local river. Next,a busy road led to a side turning that took us back to our local park,where I usually got into my stride,digging deep as Grace took up my pace behind.Turning out of our local park,I accelerated away, and staggered to a lung-bursting halt outside our front door.</p><p>‘You’re the winner,’she later laughed in the cascading shower - ‘…….is that a relay baton,or are you just pleased to see me?’</p><p>We made love standing naked by the open bedroom window, watching the sky behind the sunset flare into a burst of colours that ran down into liquid darkness of night.Over tramlines,and across train tracks,cars sped past.Then a train thundered by,so my knees trembled outside as well as inside, and - just as an illuminated tram full of face looking sightlessly at us descended around the edge of the park in silent accelerating momentum -  we reached orgasm,as they swept smoothly past to vanish into dark,as we sighed,moaned,and staggered into sweaty release.</p><p>‘You’re the winner,Grace’ I groaned a slack smile,as we fell on the bed in a tangle of limbs - but my words were nonsense….  neither winner or loser,we were by now hardly there at all.</p><p>Later,I opened my eyes with a start,and from residual light in the sky could see her body draped across the bed as if flung  beside me,touching gently as we awoke from our little death.</p><p>‘That’s better,’she said,as if a body function were dealt with. ’Are you laughing at me again,Jack Jones?’She snuggled up.</p><p>‘No,well,yes,maybe.Laughing at existence,the whole caboodle.’</p><p>‘Caboodle?You mean the whole package,life’s smorgasbord?’</p><p>‘Yes.I’m really glad I found <a href="http://you.You" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you.You</a>’re my coup-de-Grace.’</p><p>‘Oh,c’est ca,n’est pas?she responded.’Your turn to make tea.’</p><p>‘Whaat?Don’t start….I can do better - supper is in the fridge.’</p><p>…...And so it goes,on into the weekend.Saturday’s sky is clear, so she heads for her Running Sisters club,and I go to Charing Cross for my ‘Morning of Mindfulness’ meeting.We meditate as a group,in a space of open trust - with some social mingling. During frequent silences,I hear the calls of seagulls that have winged up the Thames from the open sea at Sheerness.Later,I walk over the river on Hungerford footbridge,taking in the view that inspired Wordsworth on his way to France.I visit ‘my club’ on the top floor of the Royal Festival Hall for coffee,then take a train from Waterloo to near home,from where I walk to check the <a href="http://allotment.It" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allotment.It</a> is getting out of hand as <a href="http://usual.Man" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usual.Man</a> fights back, as nature encroaches with predictable inevitability.Ah,the earth.</p><p>I have to do something about it before completely losing the plot,and so set the next few hours aside for a toil in nature’s <a href="http://church.It" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">church.It</a> is irksome labour,but I feel that I want to honour my own planetary roots to the extent that the task is a holy one - and I wade into the tangle of couchgrass and bindweed,the rotting leaves that shelter slugs and snails,bale the duckweed from the pond so that miniscule frogs can live,uproot the crops that have gone to seed,dig out the swathes of dandelions,and generally restore some sort of order,according to our human stewardship.We try to work with nature,instead of in complete opposition to its progress - and so the work is hard,and I get home utterly exhausted,but with some deep satisfaction in my  bones.Job done - tomorrow is free,and a day out is planned.</p><p>We never talked much about Julia and Jay.Grace accepted it was part of what I had to do - but as the next day was set for a Sunday walk,she asked,on our train journey to the coast: ‘So what’s happening with those two.Did it work out for them?’ ‘No.They had to leave Grunts.There’s not much can be done.’ ‘That’s too bad.I’m sure it will sort itself out in the long run.’ </p><p>‘Someone once said,’I replied: “If you save a person’s life you are forever responsible for them from then on.” Do you believe that,Grace?What was I doing,all those years ago?I feel utterly  powerless,at the mercy of their <a href="http://whims.As" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whims.As</a> much as I love them, I’ve had more than enough of them for this lifetime………’</p><p>‘No worries,Jack,’she said,taking my arm.’Let’s enjoy today….’</p><p>And we did.Changing trains at Lewes to take the branch line down to the coast,beyond the grazing marshes at Seaford,we started walking east,climbing up to traverse along chalk cliffs that define this coastline with an abruptness that mirrors the flat seascape horizon,carrying us to the Cuckmere river at the floodplain where it joins the sea in a meander of oxbow lakes.</p><p>Today,lucky with seatide,we were able to wade the rivermouth.</p><p>From the other shore we took the long steep climb back up to the height of the Seven Sisters cliffs,a switchback of downland - after which it was always a relief to reach the café at Birling Gap,a huddled settlement whose presence erosion makes very precious,but</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
