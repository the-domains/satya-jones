<p>BY NOW</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>That dream passed decades ago.Now,I am not even the same person.I texted Grace ’Okay?’and got ‘XXX’,replied straight back.</p><p>So I rose from bed,and sat on a sagging old Chesterfield sofa  under eaves,in a courtyard that also housed tractor,trailer,and ploughing equipment.I wondered if the past is a river that always turns into the present.People painting fresh Summer Gathering signs in the courtyard,looked up at me as I went off exploring….</p><p>There was woodland everywhere - tall young oaks,ash,and aspen lined a path leading to an large walled garden,containing a collapsed skeleton of a Victorian greenhouse,with unmanaged fruit trees against the walls.A secret garden - still and empty, shimmering in the heat,was bisected into four large beds of flowers and vegetables by four wide grassy paths that met at a central lawn.A beautiful place,a garden lost in time that in its prime would have had teams of gardeners to keep it productive. Even now,it had swathes of flowers for table decorations,and flowering runner beans,courgettes,lettuces,and potatoes.</p><p>Still feeling I was dreaming,I picked a tiny bean and ate its raw green freshness as I walked back through the gate in the wall, taking a path through woods in another direction - through a tangle of rhododendron out on a huge open lawn where kids played at the back of the redbrick House covered in vines.</p><p>The rear facade was more pleasing than the front,with flower border surround an ancient magnolia. A huge dead tree stood starkly next to live cedars,and a deep green conifer rose high into the sky to wave its creaking tip in the wind.There was a glass conservatory at one end and,centrally,a couple of steps to a back porch,where I saw Julia sitting staring into space,on a teabreak.</p><p>Why was I feeling odd as I took in this scene? Looking at my feet I saw I stood on a spiral flint path,that encroaching turf and moss slowly covered :it was a Labrynth.A spiral maze,an ancient devise for concentrating energy through tranquil contemplation gained from walking calmly along the spiral pathway – like the cross section of a human brain – from outer edge to focussed centre.</p><p>I did this,and felt my churning emotions settling to rest in the present moment - focussing into stillness at the eye of this gyre, as past hope and future possibility merged into one present reality.I was at Grunts House simply to work.To help at a Summer Gathering that took place over a long weekend fairly soon.In return I would get board,lodgings - and was free to mingle,and celebrate.Julia had invited me,and the hierarchy here had agreed. </p><p>The fact that she lived here with my now-grown son Jay added a touch of irony to the event - but it will be good to be together, and re-experience once again our unnerving family dysfunction.</p><p>We had spent half our lives crossing each others paths,in a deep palimsest of time.I wondered about her and this generation's Roger Grant - and was to discover that this inherited mansion was a fraction of his estate.He also had working farms,cottages,a heritage farm,a winding river.Sir Rog was landed gentry - but of a 1960's paradigm.He had broken the mould.There was no hunting, shooting,or fishing.Instead,he had the House functioning as a multifaith venue,hired for alternative spiritual events,nd needed workers to facilitate the busy timetable of this‘spiritual conference centre’or vatious faith groups that passed through,hiring Grunts facilities.He planned a College of Profound Learning,a Mystery School,but believed in importance of Community for its own sake.</p><p>Some workers were resident - absorbing familiar tensions twixt landowner and community.The Household was in part a family in dysfunction also,and as such it was no more than reflection of the impairment of our whole world.We humans who - aware of the catastrophic process of destroying our planetary-home biosphere - seem powerless to stop it.So who can say where madness lies?</p><p>Julia had told me the nature of the House – and told me that this Summer Gathering was to be extra special. Gatherings annually began with an Opening Procession from what I now knew was that sacred circle of stones I had seen from the driveway - but our era marked what many foresaw as the Beginning Of The End Of The World.The cataclysmic events prophecied in the Mayan calendar are honoured within the present day shamanic network, and so,as our planetary predicament deepened,recognition of this was planned for this particularly significant Summer Gathering.</p><p>Personally,I was grimly looking forward to our cultural collapse,as a System cannot be changed with the values that created it - but was content to make myself useful wherever possible.To dance in End of the World, Shiva Style,seems the cutting edge of culture. Maybe Riots were a precursor? I was prepared to throw myself into it all,despite my doubts as to its real karmic purpose - for I mistrusted my mixed motives more than the myopia of others.</p><p>The Labrynth under my feet having filtered me into to a strangely  positive state - given that the Apocalypse was soon to be here - I began to stroll the lawn’s perimeter,to complete circumnavigation of the mansion's exterior.I wandered along flowering hedgerows, down a dark yew-and-laurel arcade - and thought I heard drums as I emerged at the edge of a blue-painted swimming pool that was clearly in use but in need of cleaning - for at present it was </p><p>occupied solely by many trapped miniscule froglets.Across the way was a timber outbuilding,and through windows that ran its whole length I now saw a stage that was full of drummers,in a room that was surprisingly packed with sweaty,ecstatic dancers.</p><p>It must be a visiting shamanic group,hiring facilities and privacy. I was tempted to slip in,but it was 4 o'clock,and I had completed my exterior tour back to that same pillared entrance where Julia now sat,work shift over - ready to show me around the House.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Satya Jones</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
