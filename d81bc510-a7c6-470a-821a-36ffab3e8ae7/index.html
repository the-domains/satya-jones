<p>in perpetuity</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Then the train that I was travelling on turned into a taxi that was speeding down the peaceful dark green lanes of Dorset.</p><p>‘City riots haven’t got this far’I remember the smiling taxi driver saying as I sat up front by him,backpack flung onto rear seats. ’You’re from London aren’t you?Visitors pass through on their way to Devon and Cornwall,so they miss a treat.Staying long? he asked.This was his day job.I reckoned he played in a band.</p><p>‘Yes,the rioting got a bit close.I’ve come to stay and work at Grant’s House,preparing for the Summer Gathering,you know?</p><p>‘Yea,everyone knows Grants.Sir Roger is a local,but he won’t mingle with us villagers much.We call it ‘Grunts House’,and him,’Sir Roger Grunt’,everyone does - for so long I daresay he even calls himself that.Even email is <a href="http://www.gruntshouse.com/">www.gruntshouse.com</a>. Their Masqued Ball on the Gathering’s Saturday Night is always a good laugh though.I’ll be there for that.May see you then…’, he said,as he dropped me at the entrance of a long driveway. ’Car doesn’t like potholes,he explained,and then,’We could do with a riot in Darset,’he winked,’but I’ll settle for cash for now.’</p><p>So I paid,and the taxi drove off.I was now an urban refugee.</p><p>At the head of the drive was a small church beyond a line of ancient yews,so I traced my shadow over a broken stile for a closer look.Tall trees were in full leaf,dawn chorus was fading, and fledglings raucously soared from a rookery into the skies.</p><p>I was surprised when the latch lifted as I turned the iron ring to creak open the church door and step inside.Nothing could have been gloomier.The church was severely neglected.From a pile of black cinders in the cracked font,it would seem someone had lit a fire there.Engrimed windows shone weak sunlight onto a stained altarcloth,on which a large faded brass cross stood surrounded by mousedroppings.The dank air was icy cold.</p><p>It was a family church,as nearly all the stone war-memorials had ’Grant’,and particularly‘Roger Grant’repeated across ancestral <a href="http://generations.In" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generations.In</a> the vestry I found collapsing stacks of hymnals - their mildewed flaking leaves covered in dark spores - unbinding into featureless heaps of corruption.They smelt of death.I turned and ran back quaking though the tombstones.</p><p>It must be delayed shock.The Riot had felt like a brush with mortality,and I now was suddenly transfixed by the thought that I had no idea how I would die - but I determinedly ground this mood into the gravel under my feet, and as I strode along the driveway I saw no potholes,apart from those in my mind.</p><p><a>In fact the driveway was newly surfaced,so easy strides lifted my heart into rhythm,and with rucksack slung over shoulder,I Grant,Grunt,grunted along.I could hear my horse and carriage clip-clopping past oaks,then,curving by chestnut woods and open pastures,saw my mansion appearing through the trees.</a></p><p>As I stood to look at its brash intrusion into a quintessential English landscape,five roan deer emerged from nearby copse. Sensing me,they bolted along the driveway to scatter through green wheat in leaping waves,before regrouping by a strange broad circle of low-standing stones - then vanished back into the woodland as I shaded my eyes,peering against the light.</p><p>Yes,it seems I was seeing a Stone Circle.Not a henge from pre-history,but a living presence in the meadows,a detailed look might help clarify the nature of the man who owned this land, but my rucksack was pressing,and I was now near the House.</p><p>Behind the Doric pillars of the entrance porch,the façade of the place disappointed me.A mishmash of brick,stone facing,and broken lines,with a clambering vine of Edwardian drainpipes.An old face many times remodelled,now ancient again,and with any trace of the medaeval now long gone,it sat on tarmac curtelage that swept in from the newly-gravelled driveway.</p><p>The porch had a classical charm,offset by soggy cigarette ends floating in jamjars,beyond a tub of homely geraniums.There was no-one around so I sat on a rustic bench in the porch to see the view - now a long way from my own urban nightmare.</p><p>Beyond the driveway,my eyes swooped down the meadows to cross a lake surrounded by mature pine-trees that merged into  a forest edge,then glanced beyond uphill to where a herd of cows grazed around the trunk of a time-blasted chestnut tree that seemed a living ruin of its own past.Overall,this was a sculpted perspective of classical order,of nature tamed into harmony by Reason,Science,and the Will of Man,whose destiny God had loved - whereas now,at this precise moment in time, the panelled entrance door to the House swung open,and there stood Julia,ex-wife,as God had once arranged - so was Grunts House to be a place to celebrate an end to all human illusion?</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
